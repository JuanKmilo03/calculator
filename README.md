# Python Arithmetic Calculator

This project is a simple arithmetic calculator implemented in Python. The calculator allows you to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is designed to run in a loop, allowing you to perform multiple operations until you choose to exit.

## Features

### Options:

1. **Addition**
2. **Subtraction**
3. **Multiplication**
4. **Division**
5. **Exit**

### Result and examples:
- **Addition**: Allows you to add two numbers.
  - Example: If you select addition and enter 5 and 3, the program will display `5 + 3 = 8`.

- **Subtraction**: Allows you to subtract one number from another.
  - Example: If you select subtraction and enter 10 and 4, the program will display `10 - 4 = 6`.

- **Multiplication**: Allows you to multiply two numbers.
  - Example: If you select multiplication and enter 7 and 6, the program will display `7 * 6 = 42`.

- **Division**: Allows you to divide one number by another, with special handling for division by zero.
  - Example: If you select division and enter 20 and 4, the program will display `20 / 4 = 5.0`.
  - If you attempt to divide by zero, the program will display an error message: `Error: Division by zero is not allowed.`

### Exit Option:
The program includes an exit option (option 5), allowing you to gracefully terminate the program when youâ€™re finished performing calculations.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need to have Python 3.0 or higher installed on your system.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the Program**: Execute the script in a Python environment.
2. **Select an Operation**: When prompted, enter the number corresponding to the operation you want to perform.
3. **Enter Numbers**: Input the numbers you wish to calculate.
4. **View the Result**: The program will display the result of the calculation.
5. **Repeat or Exit**: You can continue performing operations or choose to exit by selecting option 5.
