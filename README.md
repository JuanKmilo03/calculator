Python Arithmetic Calculator
This project is a simple arithmetic calculator implemented in Python. The calculator allows you to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program is designed to run in a loop, allowing you to perform multiple operations until you choose to exit.

Features
Options:
When you run the program, a menu appears where you can choose the mathematical operation you want to perform. Simply enter the corresponding number for the operation, and then input the numbers you wish to calculate:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Exit

View the Result:
After selecting an operation and entering the numbers, the program will display the result of the calculation. If you choose division and the divisor is 0, the program will show an error message to handle the division by zero case.

Addition: Allows you to add two numbers.

Example: If you select addition and enter 5 and 3, the program will display 5 + 3 = 8.
Subtraction: Allows you to subtract one number from another.

Example: If you select subtraction and enter 10 and 4, the program will display 10 - 4 = 6.
Multiplication: Allows you to multiply two numbers.

Example: If you select multiplication and enter 7 and 6, the program will display 7 * 6 = 42.
Division: Allows you to divide one number by another, with special handling for division by zero.

Example: If you select division and enter 20 and 4, the program will display 20 / 4 = 5.0.
If you attempt to divide by zero, the program will display an error message: Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
Exit Option:
The program includes an exit option (option 5), allowing you to gracefully terminate the program when youâ€™re finished performing calculations.
